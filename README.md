**Lesion-Segmentation-nnUNet**

Automated lesion segmentation of chronic stroke T1-weighted (T1w) MRI scans using nnU-Net.

This repository provides scripts and pretrained models fo automatically segmenting chronic stroke lesions from T1w images. You can apply our trained models to segment your own MRI scans.

- Input: Chronic T1w MRI of a stroke patient
- Output: Binary lesion map

The folder includes three subdirectories:

* scripts/ â€“ Shell scripts to run the segmentation pipeline
* work/ â€“ Output directory where your results will be saved
* results/ â€“ Pretrained nnU-Net model files

ðŸš€ How to Run

Use the script _runlesionseg.sh_ to run the segmentation. 
Please see the script for:
* Required software installations
* Environment setup instructions
